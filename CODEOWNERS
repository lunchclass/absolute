# Absolute Project Owners
* @romandev

# There will be a lot of pull requests in each modules but we don't have enough
# owners for review process. So, we make the following people become temporary
# owners to digest each module reviews. They are not official owners who are
# nominated by official process but are much contributing to each modules.
# So, we believe that they can take responsibility for each modules.
# Push
server/push/* @JayChl
client/push/* @JayChl
client/service-worker*.js @JayChl

# Order
server/order/* @coconutperm

# Build
gulpfile.babel.js @nadongguri
