## Prepare reviews
### Check CI
Reviews should be started after passing all CI tests. CI is automatically ran when you create a pull-request.

## Find reviewers
### Code Owners
You can assign reviewers for your pull-requests but an approval of code owners is required to merge you patch to the mater branch.
Code owners are requested as reviewers automatically if your patch includes the source that the code owner is responsible for.
[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/lunchclass/absolute/blob/master/CODEOWNERS)
```
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# Absolute Project Owners
* @romandev
```

### When modifying existing code
It is recommended to add contributors who related to your patches as reviewers.
You can find the contributor who commited related code using "git blame".

ex) If you want to know who modified source code line 1 ~ 3 in absolute.cmd
```
git blame -L 1,3 HEAD^ absolute.cmd

git blame -L 1,3 absolute.cmd

```

## Request reviews
If you are a code owner, please review within 24 hours when you get review requests. (Exclude holidays and weekends)
At least reviewers should leave the meaningful comment.
Do not critisize and aggressive to reviewees. Please respect. :D

## Approve reviews
Reviews are approved when code owners comment *LGTM* then approve. *LGTM* means `Looks Good to me`.

Those acronyms are often used.
- **LGTM**: **L**ooks **G**ood **T**o **M**e
- **IMHO**: **I**n **M**y **H**umble **O**pinion
- **PTAL**: **P**lease **T**ake **A** **L**ook
- **nit**:  A small change that may not be very important, but is technically correct.
- **ditto**: The same

## After approving reviews
You have to check if the conflicting occurs when fetch and rebase based on upstream before merging.
```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master

# when resolve is required because of conflict files
git rebase --continue
```
