Contents of the "acorn" subdirectory for UnZip 5.4 and later:

  acorn.c.acorn     Acorn-specific resources
  acorn.c.riscos    mainly file-handling routines for FileCore-based filesystems
  acorn.Contents    this file
  acorn.GMakeFile   Makefile for gcc
  acorn.h.riscos
  acorn.h.swiven
  acorn.makefile    Makefile script for default Acorn C compiler
  acorn.README      notes about Acorn-specific features
  acorn.RunMe1st    Obey file to move files into suitable place for compilation
                    on RISC OS machines
  acorn.s.swiven    SWI veneers
  acorn.srcrename   small executable that converts files from Unix style to
                    RISC OS style, used by RunMe1st

Notes:

  Use the "RunMe1st" file (it is an Obey file) to convert all the files from
  "filename/[chs]" to "[chs].filename" (so that UnZip could be easily compiled
  under RISC OS). It will also set the correct makefile.

  To compile just set the CSD to the main UnZip directory and run 'amu'.

  Currently only the Acorn C V5 compiler has been tested but probably also
  Acorn C V4 and the Acorn Assembler V2 will be able to compile UnZip.
