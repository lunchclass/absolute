This subdirectory contains the master source files for the UnZip user
documentation. Although these documents are Unix man-page sources, they
are of general interest and therefore stored separately.
Some non-Unix systems may supply a man-page reader where they could be
used; and they are the sources for the generic ASCII text document files.
