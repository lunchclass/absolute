Contents of the "amiga" directory for UnZip 5.5 and later:

  Contents      this file
  amiga.c       Amiga-specific file I/O routines
  amiga.h       Amiga-specific header file
  filedate.c    SetFileDate clone for OS 1.3, and other low-level resources

  smakefile     SAS/C makefile for UnZip, fUnZip, and UnZipSFX

  makefile.azt  Aztec C makefile for UnZip, fUnZip, and UnZipSFX
  stat.c        stat() emulation for Aztec, along with opendir()/readdir()/etc
  z-stat.h      replacement stat.h header file for use with stat.c
  crc_68.a      assembler version of crc32.c
  flate.a       assembler version of inflate_codes() (define ASM_INFLATECODES)

  makesfx.c     source for MakeSFX, without which UnZipSFX is not usable

Notes:

  The crc_68.a source file is not currently used by the SAS/C makefile,
  nor is flate.a; as of UnZip 5.2 neither of these wants args in
  registers.

  The DICE makefile has been removed since no one is supporting that
  compiler anymore.

  As of UnZip 5.2, if you have AmigaDOS 2.1 or newer and have set your
  timezone in the Locale preferences editor, this will be an adequate
  substitute for setting TZ.  If you do not set TZ to your current timezone,
  files will be restored with times corrsponding to "EST5EDT", U.S. Eastern
  time.  See ../proginfo/timezone.txt for directions on how to set the
  TZ variable.
