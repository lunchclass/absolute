This should be considered an initial port - there will probably be some
bugs and non-functioning features.

The only functionality that has had any real testing is "unzip filename",
anything else is basically untested.

This has been cross-compiled from DOS using Metaware's High C compiler
and the DOS version of pamake (v3.0).  It should compile with the FlexOS
hosted version of HighC, and the makefile could be converted to work
with the native FlexOS make.

The following considerations apply:

)Compiled against and linked with portlib.
)Used on FlexOS 286 v2.32
)Volume labels are not supported - this is due to the way FlexOS decides
 if a drive has case-sensitive filenames based upon the contents of the
 volume label.
)No special handling for case-sensitive media (see above).
)Not using the PORTLIB wildarg routine (i.e., UnZip does its own globbing).
)Based upon the MSDOS port.
)Filenames are in FAT format.
)The current version of getch is a cheat (simply using getchar()).  I
 should interrogate stdin and if it's a FlexOS console use special code
 to turn off echo and just read one char.
)Only the basic MSDOS FAT file attributes are saved/restored.  There is
 currently no support for the FlexOS extended file attributes.
)There is some code that should attempt to do the correct thing when a
 pathspec with a logical name definition is used (e.g., "system:path/to/it");
 however it again has not been stress-tested.
)There is no special handling for floppy drives, there probably should
 be.
)The dateformat is compiled in as DMY (shoot me I'm British),  I'm not
 sure if there is actually a way to get locale info.
)The assembler speedups haven't yet been ported to ASM86 (should simply
 be a change of syntax)
