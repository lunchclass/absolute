  makefile.emx   makefile for GNU C, emx 0.9c port, gnu make

Notes:

(1) Two makefiles for djgpp/GNU make are provided, one for djgpp 1.12 and one
    for djgpp v2.x.  In addition, the Unix makefile (unix/Makefile) contains
    a djgpp v2.x target using the go32-gcc cross compiler on Linux.  Read the
    appropriate makefile sections for details.

(2) The makefile for emx+gcc has been used with GNU Make ports from DJGPP and
    the GNUish MS-DOS project.  Other make utilities may work, too.  The
    resulting executables require emx.exe or rsx.exe to run (akin to djgpp
    1.x's go32.exe).

(3) The OS/2 makefile includes several (cross compilation ?) targets to
    generate MS-DOS executables which can be used with MSC 6.0 or later
    (`mscdos', 16-bit), Watcom C/C++ 9.0 or later (`watcom16dos', 16-bit;
    `watcomdos' and `pmodew', 32-bit) and emx+gcc 0.9c or later (`gccdos',
    32-bit). These targets have only been tested in cross-compilation from
    OS/2 to MS-DOS, but they may work on a plain MS-DOS system, when a proper
    make utility is available.
