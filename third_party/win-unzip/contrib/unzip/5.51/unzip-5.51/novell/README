1) I used the Watcom version 11 compiler and the Novell NetWare SDK
   from October 1998.  You can get the latest NetWare SDK (free).  Go to
   http://developer.novell.com/ndk/netware.htm#C/C++ and look for "NLM and
   NetWare Libraries for C (including CLIB and XPlat)"

2) The unzip.nlm runs in the same address space as the NetWare OS.
   In other words, if unzip.nlm crashes, the server will most likely crash.
   Therefore, I recommend you do not load unzip.nlm on a server that your
   company depends on for business until it's been thoroughly tested on a
   test server.

3) I've designed this unzip.nlm port to load on any version of NetWare
   starting with NetWare 3.12.  However, I've tested it only on NetWare 5.0.
   If unzip.nlm does not load or run correctly, try the following in
   this order:

        a) Load clibaux.nlm version 1.21a or later before loading
           unzip.nlm.  The clibaux.nlm is part of the NetWare SDK package
           mentioned above.  It's also part of the 3.x C library package
           mentioned below.

        b) On NetWare 3.x, install the latest 3.x C library modules.
           Go to http://support.novell.com/misc/patlst.htm#nw and look for
           "NetWare 3.12/3.2 CLIB".

        c) On NetWare 4.10, install the latest 4.10 C library modules.
           Go to http://support.novell.com/misc/patlst.htm#nw and look for
           "Updated modular CLIB and DSAPI".

        d) On NetWare 4.11 and 4.2, install the latest support pack.
           Go to http://support.novell.com/misc/patlst.htm#nw and look for
           "NetWare 4 Support Pack".

4) This unzip.nlm assumes that support for the long name space (also
   known as the OS/2 name space) has already been added to the current
   working volume.  If it has not, and the zip archive contains files with
   long names, then the fopen() for such files will just fail.  The code
   does not attempt to rename the file to fit in a DOS-style name.  The same
   problem would occur with long directory names.

5) If unzip.nlm works correctly on NetWare 3.x (which it should,
   but I've not tried it), it will create all files and directories with
   all-uppercase names. The reason is that the NetWare 3.x C library does
   not support creating mixed-case or lowercase file names, even in the long
   (OS/2) name space.

6) To change the current working volume and current working directory
   in which unzip.nlm loads and runs, load unzip.nlm like this:

        load unzip <unzip options> (CLIB_OPT)/P<volume>:<directory>

   For example:

        load unzip archive.zip (CLIB_OPT)/Pvol1:\usr\home

   For more information on CLIB_OPT, go to http://developer.novell.com/search/
   and enter "CLIB_OPT" in the "Novell Developer Kit Search" box.

7) To find out more about clibaux.nlm, go to
   http://developer.novell.com/search/ and enter "clibaux" in the "Novell
   Developer Kit Search" box.
