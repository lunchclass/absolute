Contents of the "unix" subdirectory for UnZip 5.3 and later:

  Contents      this file
  Makefile      makefile for UnZip for various architectures and OS's
  unix.c        Unix-specific support routines
  unxcfg.h      Unix-specific configuration settings
  zipgrep       script to scan zip archive entries for lines matching a pattern

Type "make" or "make help" to get general compile instructions (beyond
those in the INSTALL file), or "make list" for a list of makefile targets.
Note that there are some MS-DOS and cross-compilation targets thrown in
just to make things more exciting.
