MAKE/VMS is no longer supported since MMK (MMS clone by Matt Madison/MadGoat
Enterprises, compatible with descrip.mms) is both free and becoming quite
popular.  MMK is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.spc.edu/ftp.wku.edu and
by mailserver at lists.wku.edu.  Check VMS newsgroups for announcements and
exact location.

The MAKE_UNZ.COM command file accepts compilation options in a LOCAL_UNZIP
symbol or logical; the format is "VMSCLI,RETURN_CODES" (for example).
DESCRIP.MMS must be edited in order to use special options.
