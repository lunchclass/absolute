  nt.h          WinNT-specific support header
  rsxntwin.h    supplement header for RSXNT, fills holes in their <windows.h>
  w32cfg.h      Win32-specific configuration, included by unzpriv.h
  win32.c       Win32-specific support routines

crc_i386.c has been tested with MSVC but not integrated into any makefile
yet.  It is provided for those who may have MSVC but no assembler.  Note
that some C compilers on Pentium-class machines have been reported to emit
faster code from the plain C sources (crc32.c) than the assembler routines
provide.  This has not been tested lately, however.
