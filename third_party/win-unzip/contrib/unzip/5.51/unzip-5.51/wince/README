   About the Windows CE Port (known as "Pocket UnZip")
_______________________________________________________________________________

The Windows CE port, known as Pocket UnZip, is designed to run on Microsoft's
Windows CE operating system.  The port is completely contained in the files
listed above.  There were very few minor modifications made to the Info-ZIP
code in order for this port to work.  This was possible because the Info-ZIP
code is fairly generic and also because several hooks have already been placed
in the code from past Windows ports.  The Windows CE port leverages off of
these efforts for two reasons.  Mainly, I wanted to avoid modifying the
Info-ZIP core code since people don't like it when your changes break other
ports.  Second, this makes the Windows CE port easy to upgrade when fixes and
features are released by the Info-ZIP group.

The port is made up of the project file (punzip.dsp), one global header
(punzip.h), three main source modules (winmain.cpp/h, intrface.cpp/h,
and wince.cpp/h), the resource script files (punzip.rc, punzip.rcv, and
resource.h), several resources (punzip.ic2, zipfile.ic2, imglist.2bp,
ilmask.bmp, toolbar.2bp, punzip.ico, zipfile.ico, imglist.bmp, and
toolbar.bmp), and the help file (punzip.htp).

The application's entry point is WinMain(), which is located in winmain.cpp
(what a surprise).  winmain.cpp basically contains all the Windows code and
the user interface.  It knows nothing about the Info-ZIP code or things like
the Globals struct.  That stuff is the job of the intrface module.
intrface.cpp implements an easy (or at least easier) to understand interface
to the Info-ZIP routines.  It also handles all the callbacks from Info-ZIP
and relays the appropriate information back to the code in winmain.cpp.
The final module is wince.cpp.  This module implements all the Win32 APIs
and C runtime functions that are called by the rest of the code, but are
not natively implemented on Windows CE.  Most all of this module is excluded
for NT native builds.

Two preprocessor defines are used in conjunction with several defines from
the Info-ZIP code and from other ports.  The two that are specific to the
Windows CE port are:

     POCKET_UNZIP   Always set for the Windows CE port (CE and NT).
     _WIN32_WCE     Set for Windows CE native; not set for Windows NT native.

These three defines are the minimum defines that must be addressed by the
project file in order to build this port.  This port's main header, punzip.h,
gets included by all the Info-ZIP source files when POCKET_UNZIP is defined.
punzip.h in turn ensures that all the other relevant Info-ZIP defines are set
to correctly build the port.  If you wish to alter the Info-ZIP defines used
to build this port, you can do so by altering punzip.h.

There are quite a few _WIN32_WCE checks throughout the source files for this
port.  These checks allow the application to build natively for Windows NT for
debugging purposes, and just because it can with little effort due to the
similarities between the Windows CE API and the Windows NT API. Any non-Windows
CE code is assumed to be for Windows NT only.  This project currently will not
work on Windows 95 because Windows CE is mostly UNICODE, and this port assumes
that all Win32 calls to the operating system take UNICODE parameters.  I could
scatter a few dozen "#ifdef UNICODE" checks around and make it work on Windows
95, but I see no reason to complicate this port's code for that reason since
there is already a Windows 95 port of the Info-ZIP code.

   Building the Windows CE Port (known as "Pocket UnZip")
_______________________________________________________________________________

At the time this README was written, Microsoft just released Visual C++ for
Windows CE version 1.0.  This development kit uses the the standard Microsoft
Visual C++ version 5.0 or 6.0 development environment and project files
(DSP files). To build Windows CE binaries of Pocket UnZip, you will need
version 1.0 or later of Visual C++ for Windows CE.

This port's project file, punzip.dsp, contains the information for building all
the various binaries.  These include Windows NT native, Windows CE native for
Hitachi SH-3 processors, and Windows CE native for MIPS processors.  All
projects have Debug and Retail flavors as well.  The following table lists the
Windows CE devices and which binary they run:

     Manufacturer             CPU             Binary
     ---------------------    ------------    ------
     Philips Electronics      MIPS R3910      MIPS
     NEC Corp.                NEC VR4101      MIPS
     Casio Computer Co.       Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     Compaq Computer Corp.    Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     Hewlett-Packard Co.      Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     Hitachi Ltd.             Hitachi SH-3    SH-3
     LG Electronics Inc.      Hitachi SH-3    SH-3

The revision of this port made for UnZip 5.51 does now also provide a project
file for use with Microsoft's free "Visual C++ embedded 3.0" development system
for Windows CE.

Pocket UnZip should build out of the box.  If you have just unzipped the
Info-ZIP's UnZip sources, you should have a root directory with the core
Info-ZIP files in it and several subdirectories under it for the various
ports, one of which is the WinCE directory.  The project files punzip.dsp
are located in the subdirectory vc5 resp. vc6 below the wince directory.
Open the punzip.dsp file from the subdirectory matching your Visual C++
base version.  The project file uses all the files in the WinCE
subdirectory as well as the following files in the Info-ZIP root:

     api.c        crypt.h      globals.c    process.c    unzip.h
     consts.h     ebcdic.h     globals.h    ttyio.c      unzpriv.h
     crc32.c      explode.c    inflate.c    ttyio.h      unzvers.h
     crctab.c     extract.c    inflate.h    unreduce.c   zip.h
     crypt.c      fileio.c     list.c       unshrink.c

Beginning with UnZip 5.51, the source distribution contains a second port for
WinCE, providing a "command line UnZip tool" for batch processing on Windows CE
systems.
This port was contributed in September 2002 by:
    Simon Roberts
    IBM Global Services, EMEA
    Phone: (INT 44- 2392 )(UK  02392 ) 563937: Tie-line(UK): 25-3937
    Notes: Simon Roberts/UK/IBM@IBMGB
    Internet: Simon_Roberts@uk.ibm.com

The tight integration of this contribution into the main UnZip distribution
code required some reorganization and was carried out by the UnZip maintenance
coordinator Christian Spieler.

The build of the Win CE command line program requires compiling
and linking together the following source modules:

    wince/wcemain.c             main entry point
    unzip.c                     unzip command line interface
    crc32.c                     CRC-32 calculation
    crctab.c                    lookup table for CRC-32
    crypt.c                     decryption support
    extract.c                   general archive extraction handling
    fileio.c                    internal I/O helper routines
    globals.c                   global communication resources setup
    list.c                      archive listing
    match.c                     wildcard pattern matching
    process.c                   general archives processing code
    ttyio.c                     interactive console I/O
    explode.c                   decompression for "Imploded" data (LZ77)
    inflate.c                   decompression for "Deflate" methods
    unreduce.c                  decompression for "Reduced" data
    unshrink.c                  decompression for "Shrunk" data (LZW)
    wince/intrface.cpp          WinCE specific UnZip code
    wince/wince.cpp             WinCE specific C RTL lib replacements

These source modules depend on the following header files:

    zip.h                       wrapper for unzip.h used by some modules
    unzip.h                     main UnZip project header
    unzpriv.h                   extended defines for project internals
    globals.h                   global resource structures
    wince/wcecfg.h              Windows CE specific configuration
    wince/wince.h               WinCE C(++) library roundups

    consts.h                    global constant data
    crypt.h                     decryption interface
    ebcdic.h                    ASCII <--> EBCDIC translation
    tables.h                    codepage translation tables
    ttyio.h                     console I/O interface
    unzvers.h                   version/release information
    wince/intrface.h            public entities in wince/intrface.cpp
