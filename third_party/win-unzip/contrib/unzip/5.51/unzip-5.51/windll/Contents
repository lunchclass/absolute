If you want to build the UnZip DLL or the WinGUI SFX stub from the command
line, you may use the MSC Makefile supplied in the subdirectory of the
Win32 command line port.

Note that Borland C++ 5.0 is full of bugs; version 4.5 or 5.01 is recommended
instead.  If you must use Borland C++ 5.0, using the Intel optimizing compiler
is required to avoid crashes (possibly due to a bug in the stat() function in
the normal Borland compiler).  This does have the advantage of giving you a
smaller code size than the 4.52 compiler.  Borland C++ 5.01 has resolved many
of the problems seen with 5.0 and can be used reliably.
The UnZip DLL and SFXWiz have been successfully built with Borland C++ 5.5.1
from the command line. However, we do not currently have the resources to
supply project files for the Borland IDE environment (C Builder 5.x - 6.x).
For compilation with Borland C++, please use the appropiate targets supplied
in the Borland Makefile in the Win32 subdirectory.
